# BlackJack
BlackJack Game made in Unity with C#

This was made in March of 2022 as a project to learn Unity/C# and gain experience with UI. I had a really fun time learning animations and it was cool bringing 2D visuals to an old blackjack game I'd made in the console. If I was to do this project again, I'd spend some more time organizing the layout of my code, but it runs as I intended and I had a lot of fun with it.
All was made by me except some images.
To try, download Unity. Through the Unity hub >add new project> select this file BlackJackGame.
